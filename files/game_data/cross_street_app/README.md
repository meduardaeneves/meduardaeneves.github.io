This is a Cross the Street Game App. Your goal is to move the turtle using the keyboard arrows in order to reach the other side of the road, avoiding the obstacles. 
  - Each time you succeed, you gain a point and the turtle goes back to the start point so you can try again but with faster obstacles.
  - The game ends once you bump into any obstacle.

To play the game you can download the .exe file (located in "files" folder) or download all the python files in this repository and execute it in your personal code editor.
