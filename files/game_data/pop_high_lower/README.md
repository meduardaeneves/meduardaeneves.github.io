  <ul>
    <li>You will be presented with two Brazilian's cities.</li>
    <li>To gain those cities you need to press the "Start Game - Pick Initial cities Button".</li>
    <li>Your goal is to decide if the second city presented has a HIGHER or LOWER population compared to the first one.</li>
    <li>If you get it right, you will gain points and the game will continue: The second city will turn into the first and you will receive another one for the second spot.</li>
    <li>If you get it wrong, the game ends and your final points are presented.</li>
    <li>
      At the start of the game, you will be presented the following information:
      <ul>
        <li>City names, with the population of the first one.</li>
        <li>The state and region they belong, alongside the region's population</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you desire, you can ask up to two clues:
      <ul>
        <li>CLUE 01: Population of the states</li>
        <li>CLUE 02: Both cities territorial extension</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
      Your points will follow a logic:
      <ul>
        <li>0 CLUE: 3 points</li>
        <li>1 CLUE: 2 points</li>
        <li>2 CLUE: 1 points</li>
