This is a Paddle Pong Game App. It must have two players. Your goal is to hit the ball with the paddle and try to make the other opponent to miss the ball. 
  - To control the left paddle you must use "W" for up and "S" for down.
  - To control the right paddle you must use the "up arrow" for up and "down arrow" for down.
  - If your opponent misses the ball, you gain a point.
  - The game ends once one of the players reaches 5 points.

To play the game you can download the .exe file (located in "files" folder) or download all the python files in this repository and execute it in your personal code editor.
